# Okky Mabruri

I'm Okky, a data scientist based in Jakarta. I build data pipelines, alternative datasets, and applied ML systems, mostly for policy analysis and public-sector decision-making.

Right now I work at [PROSPERA](https://prospera.or.id/) (Australia Indonesia Partnership for Economic Development), where I've been turning messy, unstructured data into things governments can actually use.

- built **11+ alternative datasets** from scratch, covering labour markets, climate/energy, e-commerce, logistics, advertising, and consumer prices

    *used by policy teams across Indonesian government agencies*

- processed **3.8 million job postings** to map skills demand and detect discriminatory hiring patterns

- built an **early warning system** that monitors news, social media, and internal signals to flag emerging market-conduct issues

- indexed **6,000+ regulations** and built a RAG chatbot prototype for faster regulatory lookup

    *network analysis + retrieval-augmented generation*

- published [investigative data journalism](https://jaring.id/en/bagaimana-tagar-uu-sapu-jagat-menjadi-viral/) with Jaring.id on social media manipulation around Indonesia's Omnibus Law

- created open-source tools: [priorityx](https://okky.dev/priorityx), [news-watch](https://okky.dev/news-watch), [statskita](https://github.com/okkymabruri/statskita)

- produced **41 standardized datasets** for an election-violation monitoring portal and scraped/analyzed 10,000+ court judgments for legal transparency
